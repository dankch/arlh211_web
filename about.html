                        <p>Hong Kong and Turkey are both transient regions, in that the “now” is separate from their futures. Hong Kong is undergoing an era of political change, as it sits right in the middle of the 50 year “one country two systems” policy, after which it will officially lose its autonomy to the ruling of Mainland China, but there is no telling what China has in mind for Hong Kong[1]. Turkey is slightly different to Hong Kong in that it is changing from its own volatile political situations, sitting between Europe and the Middle East, both influencing Turkey to switch back and forth between centralization and decentralization[2].</p>

                        <p>In 2015, five Hong Kongese booksellers were abducted by the Mainland Chinese government for voicing dissent against the ruling party, this incident of abduction is referred to as the Causeway Bay Books disappearances. While media and journalism had always been heavily regulated in the Mainland, Hong Kong was an exception due to its status as a British colony until 1997. Hong Kong was granted the “one country two systems” policy for the subsequent 50 years following 1997, providing Hong Kong with a certain degree of autonomy until 2047. Despite this fact, Mainland China still exerts a lot of influence over Hong Kong’s development and politics[3].</p>

                        <p>Hong Kong’s own government is indirectly ruled by Mainland China, causing tension from residents against government backed projects like the East Lantau Metropolis project, a huge budget land reclamation project which was proposed as a solution to the housing shortage issues. Hong Kong’s population density is already among the highest in the world, but the huge population of the Mainland brings in even more potential buyers for Hong Kong properties, causing an ever-escalating shortage on housing and inflation on an already unaffordable housing market. Some Hong Kong locals antagonize Mainlanders, causing discrimination despite their similar origins[4].</p>

                        <p>The arrests of journalists by the Turkish government and the murder of Jamal Khashoggi by foreigners in Turkey show a similar dystopian scenario for the Turkish population. Even though Turkey’s current president was democratically elected, his election changed the country from a parliamentary government to a presidential government, centralizing power. This change had caused scholars and foreign journalists to voice their concerns on whether Turkey can still be considered a democracy under the new ruling[5]. The decline of democracy also led to the 2013 Gezi Park protests, which were ultimately met with media censorship and further suppression of the freedom of press.</p>

                        <p>Turkey’s current regime can be described as totalitarian, but it is also more stable compared to the years before and after 1980, when the 1970s financial crisis was so dire that working class wages and small businesses were cut to fund large companies in a neoliberal act, and the 1980 coup placed a regime that caused mass surveillance and oppression[6], which is part of the reason leading to the drastic change in architecture[7]. Turkey had also always suffered from the surrounding region’s turmoil, with refugees immigrating and creating large informal settlements known as gecekondus, creating conditions like the Hong Kong Pok Fu Lam village where the settlements occupy a grey area within the regional laws and have basic amenities within their communities[8].</p>

                        <p>The origins of present-day Turkey dates to the Ottoman Empire. Its origin as a sultanate show influence on its culture even today, where the government is heavily centralized. The Ottoman Empire’s centralization is visualized through the architectural style of large buildings and minarets that seemingly reach the skies to dominate the surrounding territories[9]. Its rules were authoritarian, what with the harems and military ruling, but the authoritarian rules also came with a promised living standard for the lower classes, where imarets provide meals for civilians and mosques provide public amenities[10]. It is perhaps ironic that the Ottoman Empire had more security for its civilians compared to Turkey in the 1980s.</p>

                        <p>Compared to Turkey, Hong Kong went through a period of oppressive ruling during the colonial era, which resulted in segregation by race and class, causing a different style of top-down planning. The footprints of the original colonial planning still influence Hong Kong today, with districts like the Victoria Peak and Repulse Bay being high-end residences[11]. During Hong Kong’s time as a colony, Mainland China went through the Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution, drastically changing the government from the original Qing Dynasty that Hong Kong was separated from. The colonization had caused a massive cultural dissociation between Hong Kong and the Mainland, partially contributing to the discriminatory practices of Hong Kongese citizens against the Mainland Chinese.</p>

                        <p>Despite protests from local populations, the Hong Kong government still went ahead with projects like the High-Speed Rail connecting Hong Kong to Guangzhou and Shenzhen. Economists raise concern over whether the monetary investment into the project would be profitable for Hong Kong, while residents are concerned that having immigration checkpoints in the heart of West Kowloon essentially surrenders Hong Kong land to the Mainland[12]. The reality is that the border between Hong Kong and the Mainland is being eroded for better or worse, even though projects along the border like the Lok Ma Chau Loop redevelopment project still face heavy roadblocks due to cultural differences between the two areas.</p>

                        <p>Contemporary Turkish architecture share some similarities to Hong Kong’s architecture in that it involves top-down planning. Whereas Hong Kong’s are due to several reasons like population density and Chinese government persuasion forcing extra regulations, Turkish architects instead adopted styles that fit in line with government mandates after the 1980 coup, following government master plans for development[13]. Architects found ways to be subtly referential with their designs, like how the Sürücüler Terrace Houses reference the Cappadocia caves. On top of the more reserved design approach, the Turkish architects also explore ways to create a Turkish architectural identity through use of local industrial material like steel.</p>

                        <p>Turkey and Hong Kong are both regions heavily affected by their borders and there is no telling how the future will affect these two regions, and there is an insecurity experienced by the population of both regions, as what laws and rights citizens have today may not be the same tomorrow. Hong Kong is under the threat of losing its democracy, while Turkey is situated in an unstable region and has an unstable government that is heavily regulating its media. The transience of the two regions is what causes these places to be dystopian at heart, even if utopian on the surface.</p>

		<h1> Author</h1>
			<hr>
			<h6>Ian Tse is a local Hong Kong undergraduate currently studying game design as his major. He was raised in Hong Kong during his childhood years but had lived in Shanghai since he was 10. After graduating from his high school, he studied landscape architecture in Sydney for 3 years, but ultimately returned to Hong Kong to pursue a different path. Today he learns how to create games, and more so than just learning the technicalities he is also learning to integrate narrative into his game stories, as such he looks across many different mediums for inspiration when building his game universes.</h6>
