                        <p>Hong Kong is a cosmopolitan city of the east, as known as the Pearl of Orient. Hong Kong has gone through rapid changes in culture, economy and politic during the colonial history ruled by Britain. Turkey is a country sitting between Europe and Middle East. The geographical location influences Turkey in terms of culture, economy and politic. Both places are serving as important trading port to surrounding areas, Hong Kong is the key connection between China and foreign countries; and Turkey is connecting Europe and Middle East. For which, it brings in cash flow and allows development in different fields in both directions of top down and bottom up.[1]</p>

                        <p>Hong Kong as a small city in the East has a complex historical background in comparison with Turkey as a country in Middle East. Due to the trade deficit in Qing Dynasty, western countries used opium as a tool to turn the situation and which led to the Opium War in 1840s.  Hong Kong was ceded to the British government. Since then Hong Kong has undergone a series of rapid changes from socialism to capitalism. During late 19th century, Turkey experienced few massive rallies in its history causing the unstable political system by switching between democratic and dictatorship.  Hong Kong is undergoing a progress of switching from democratic to one-party dictatorship as transitional practice to ease the cultural shock after unchanging the system for 50 years[2].</p>

                        <p>Kowloon walled city in Hong Kong was a miracle and mysterious area created due to the unclarified rule of the area.  It was a complete bottom up development started with dwelling units. Due to the unclarified governing tax, rent and other spending were cheaper surrounding areas. It attracted manufacturers to setup business, on the other hand, it unfortunately became a bed of crime. All units were built on top of each other, it created interconnected path vertically and horizontally among the whole walled city. Alleys and stairs were reduced to minimal that buildings shared stairs in between. Despite its dark and chaotic appearance, the walled city was productive and lively behind the rumours. It was torn down for urban redevelopment in mid 1990s.[3]</p>

                        <p>In Turkey, small contractor apartment buildings dictated for decades in mid-to-late 20th century.  Free standing single or multi-family houses were regulated in size and height by similar building plot dimensions throughout Turkey. The post-upheaval architecture had greatly influenced by “Young Turk architects” particularly in housing. After condemning zoning laws and municipal regulations for restricting architecture styles, the quality of housing had raised and raised awareness of it. In the early experimentations, Turkish architects practiced and demonstrated modernist architecture to the country. In early 21st century, the young generation of architects overcame the homogenizing effect of repetitive buildings. A matrix of fixed and variable elements could combine in hundreds of options for residents. [4]</p>

                        <p>During the Ottoman rule, it territories was highly centralised with architecture. and urbanism were used to centralize the empire’s territories. In 14th century, the Ottoman Empire conquered Constantinople, relocated its capital to it. Istanbul, former Constantinople renamed by the empire, was greatly influenced by the Byzantine architectural style and Islamism. The Hagia Sophia, a Byzantine church that converted to a Muslim mosque by adding minarets while retaining its structure underneath as an Islamic element. The new Ottoman architecture style also took place in infrastructure. It ruled by the harems and military, the authoritarian rules had a stable living standard for the lower classes. The establishment of imarets functioned as a community with functional building types.[5]</p>

                        <p>During Hong Kong’s colonial period, architecture consisted Chinese, British and colonial architectures.
Colonial structures indicated the period of suppressive governing but also represent Hong Kong. Hong Kong underwent a series of top down development due to segregation of class, which eventually led to the demolition of the walled city.  While Hong Kong under the rule of the British government, Mainland China was going through civil war and cultural revolution. The rapid changes of both Hong Kong and China created a disassociation in between. [6]</p>

                        <p>Hong Kong’s urban development had rapidly changed during colonial period in areas of architecture and living conditions. Urbanisation is heavily affected by policy and current situation. Segregation took places in colonial history, it separated British and local citizens. Until mid 20th century, a top down urban reform was carried out. For which, it shaped the contemporary Hong Kong with high-rises and better infrastructures due to industrialisation and the rapid economic and population growth. With the advanced infrastructure and urban planning, Hong Kong became the biggest trading port and still one of the global financial centre.[7]</p>

                        <p>Turkey locates between Europe and Middle East and plays the role as an important trading centre. Cultural exchanges often take place in Turkey especially in Istanbul. Turkish architects adapted styles from western and Islamic cultures. Contemporary Turkish architect shows conceptual values from Islamic thinking and visual values from modernist and post-modernist styles. Structures’ designs were down to its minimal while retaining its function. Architects often used advanced industrial materials, employed technological progress and used computerised methods. They experimented the system of new Islamic design in housing and infrastructure.[8]</p>

                        <p>In 2014, the Umbrella Revolution took place and the contestants occupied few districts in Hong Kong, including Admiralty, Central and Mong Kok. This political movement lasted 79 days demanding democracy and free election due to the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress’s decision of selective candidates for the election of Hong Kong’s chief executive. It ended with policemen clearance with tear gas and water canon. The next year in 2015, 5 Hong Kong booksellers were missing suddenly and later on appeared in China under arrest. There was rumor about the Chinese government assigned special agent over the border to threaten voices against their governing. It created a great concern of whether the 50 years unchanged policy is being respected by the Chinese government.[9]</p>

                        <p>In comparison with Hong Kong’s situation, Turkey’s situation is more intense as the Turkey’s current president changed the system of the country from parliamentary government to presidential government in order to centralize authority. To eliminate the opposing voice against the government, the Turkish government is accused of the arrests of journalists and the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. This change led to huge concerns by scholars and journalists on whether Turkey will remain to be a democratic country under the new ruling power. The switch of political system took places in history.</p>

			<hr>
			<h6>I grew up on an island in Hong
Kong which is where the story
starts. Coming along in a traditional
atmosphere is how I get
influenced. The very first time I
had fast food was at a cantonese
cafe, I can never forget the
taste and the vibe. I became a
huge fan of local culture and
always use it as inspiration.   </h6>
