                        <p>From the past to the present-day, Turkey and the Hong Kong-Shenzhen Metropolis Area have revealed internal struggles of oppressive power, urban spatial headaches, and the people’s response of objection and disapproval have triggered external upheavals of extreme political and social phenomena that have resulted in violence, opposing sides, and turbulence for the individuals occupying these complex landscapes.  Dystopian in nature but not in appearance, these two urban systems have surfaces that appear bright while their underlying reality is dark.

                        <p>The year of 1980 was fiercely transformative and brought swift changes in Turkey.  It was a period of interruption between the civilians and the military-based governance, known as a coup d’état. The coup d’état of 1980 is known to be a distinct, dramatic chronological marker that transformed Turkish architecture [1].  Like Turkey, the year of 1997 was fiercely transformative and brought swift changes in Hong Kong and inevitably led to reverberations in Shenzhen and Mainland China.  The Handover of 1997 resulted in Hong Kong becoming an “Special Autonomous Region” (SAR), which allowed Hong Kong to control its own legal, economic, and citizen independence separately from Mainland China.  It also established Hong Kong Basic Law, introducing the idea of a “One Country, Two Systems” principle [2].  Acquiring privileges like education, healthcare, and visa-free travel, the people of Hong Kong gained more access, therefore, more autonomy.  Although the Turkish coup d’état of 1980 and the Hong Kong Handover of 1997 were displays of past dystopian, they both led to a less conservative environment and made room for outside influence in their urban landscape.</p>

                        <p>The Arab Springs, a series of protests across the Middle East, began in late 2010 with revolts in Tunisia in response to oppressive regimes and a low standard of living. [3]  Just as Turkey was seeing positive political and economic progress, as in democratic headway and economic growth, during the 2000s, the people of the flourishing urban landscape and outside of it began to question Turkey’s position in the greater Middle East.  Ultimately, the Arab Springs allowed Turkey to reaffirm its democratic position and identity and led to Turkey becoming a top advocate of democracy across the region.</p>

                        <p>The Umbrella Movement, a series of ‘sit-in’ street protests, broke out in Hong Kong from September to December of 2014 in response to the proposed reforms to the electoral system of the SAR, specifically the election of the Chief Executive.  To the people of Hong Kong, these proposed reforms were seen as restrictive and drew a relationship to the Chinese Communist Party.  Taking to the streets, the police force responded by using tear gas, while the people of Hong Kong used umbrellas as their shields [4]. Today, the umbrella remains a symbol of a more democratic Hong Kong, resonating with the civilians and their fight for a voice.</p>

                        <p>With a past dating back to the Ottoman Empire, the fall of the Empire, and a number of coup d’états throughout their history, Turkey has seen a multitude of swift changes and, therefore, it’s infrastructure has dramatically transformed and evolved.  The historical timeline, specifically the end of eras and the beginning of new ones, have indicated the visual aesthetic of the buildings and have held commentary relevant to that time. The Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, which is present-day Turkey, has set an example, remaining the inspiration for structures holding more than just the surface meaning.  Today, the Sapphire Building in Istanbul is the tallest skyscraper in Turkey, accommodating business, commercial, and residential functions down by Young Turk Architects [5]. This could be seen as evident that Turkey may be moving towards a more urban metropolis, like Hong Kong.</p>

                        <p>The development of Hong Kong’s infrastructure has perpetuated continual growth. Known for its hundreds and thousands of high rises that align the city, the planning and delivery mechanisms utilized in building such a well-developed urban system plays a vital part in distinguishing Hong Kong’s overall urban disaster resilience and city’s function as a whole [6].  Geographically, Hong Kong’s urbanism provides spatial and social mobility and has nurtured a transportation system of assumed reliability and efficiency.  Considered an urban growth phenomenon, Hong Kong’s spatially functioning system of mobility grant the people access and autonomy while the high rise buildings hold a symbol of a rising power in the global economy [7].</p>

                        <p>Founded in 1923 after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, Turkey is defined as having ‘acted as both a barrier and bridge’ located between two continents, Asia and Europe, and ‘at the crossroads of the Balkans, Caucasus, Middle east, and Eastern Mediterranean.’  It has a multitude of bordering cities like Greece and Bulgaria on the west, Syria and Iraq to the southeast, and Armenia and Georgia to the east.  All of these bordering countries not only hold geographical importance but also play an important part of Turkey’s role in their economic market [8].</p>

                        <p>Located on the Far East trade routes, Hong Kong is one of the major ports of the world.
The port has been and remains a key component for the development and prosperity of the urban landscape as whole.  Known as a “free trade port city”, Hong Kong serves the South Asian Pacific region and acts as a entrepot for Mainland China.  The interaction between Hong Kong and Shenzhen has created a deliberate exchange and dependency between the two geographical conscious landscapes [9]. Shenzhen, a representation of Mainland China’s economic reform era, underwent an explosion into a urban metropolis of a population over 15 million plus in the past 30 years and is currently seen as a huge manufacturing hub that offers job opportunity and a vast center of cash flow.

                        <p>On the 2nd of October, a Washington Post columnist, Jamal Khashoggi, was brutally murdered by a group of Saudi Arabians in Istanbul’s consulate with a bone saw.  Khashoggi was an outspoken journalist who uncovered many claims on corrupt political systems. As the group of Saudi intelligence agents, including a military general,  tried to cover up the murder, the investigation heightened around the premeditated murder of the journalist.  Turkey’s President, Tayyip Erdogan, had made vague comments on the brutal murder which amplified skepticism and distrust within the political system [10].</p>

                        <p>One of the five Hong Kong publishers, Lam Wing-kee, a 61-year-old manager of the Causeway Bay bookstore, had mysteriously disappeared in 2015.  It is known by media that the local bookseller was kidnapped by Chinese ‘special forces’ after a planned bid to silence criticism of China’s communist leadership.  As he was entering mainland China, Lam was confined by the Chinese special forces in October of 2015 and noted that he spent a segment of time in solitary confinement. The bookseller, as well as the others who mysteriously disappeared, had commented on not only Communist party-led events, but also ‘salacious tomes’ about the private lives of the top Chinese leaders.  Lam had stated, “Hongkongers will not bow down before brute force,” touching on the people’s resilience with the governance [11].</p>

                        <p>Conclusively, Turkey and Hong Kong have seen their fair share of brutality, oppression and upheavals that may have seemed temporary and provisional, whether it be subtle or outspoken.  As stated, dystopian in nature but not in appearance, these two urban systems have surfaces that appear bright while their underlying reality is dark.  Although both thriving within their worlds of economics, having an upper hand geographically, and culturally thriving as a people, Hong Kong and Turkey have had their battles.
