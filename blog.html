                        <p>Hong Kong is well known as an intercultural city of East and West. From the rule of British colonial government to the handover to China, Hong Kong’s architecture and urbanism were influenced by both regimes due to the political environment. Hong Kong used to be a major trading port for foreign countries to purchase Chinese products like tea and silk in the Qing dynasty. Due to the Opium War, Hong Kong was ceded as a colony to the British government. Since then, Hong Kong has undergone a series of rapid economical and infrastructure development, thus becoming one of the most important cities in the world[1].</p>

                        <p>From Colonial to Contemporary Hong Kong, the urban environment changed rapidly in terms of cityscape, building types, and living environment. In both periods, the urban environment has been heavily affected by policy or issues happening at the time. Back in the early colonial period, the city had a clear segregation policy to separate British and local citizens. The best areas in the city such as the Peak were occupied by white people while local citizens were pushed to other areas. The urban environment was still in the shape of a small town. Due to industrialisation and rapidly increasing population in 1950s, the colonial government reformed infrastructure and public services, and high-rise buildings started to appear while high density living environments took shape. Nowadays, Hong Kong has been developed as a global financial center with lots of skyscrapers and advanced infrastructure. Behind the gloss of the advanced urban environment, overcrowded living conditions and unaffordable property prices are the new challenges contemporary Hong Kong is facing[2].</p>

                        <p>From the colonial period, Hong Kong architecture has consisted of Chinese architecture, British architecture and colonial architecture. Among these, colonial architecture characterises the Hong Kong style the most. It incorporated British architecture styles with design characteristics of Hong Kong to create hybrid architecture that symbolized the city. The old Supreme Court and Victoria Prison are two famous examples of this style. Nowadays, many old historical buildings have been demolished to make space for new architecture due to the shortage of land supply. Contemporary Hong Kong architecture emphasizes Modernism, Postmodernism, and Functionalism architecture. Skyscrapers along Victoria Harbour forms the well-known skyline while demonstrating the prosperity of Hong Kong[3].</p>

                        <p>Turkey, a transcontinental country located in Middle East, is often seen as the connection between Asia and Europe. Due to its geographical condition, Turkey is less traditional than other Islamic countries due to the influence of the Western world. From the former Ottoman Empire to the modern Turkish republic, the architecture and urbanism of the country has been highly influenced by the religious and political environment. In the Ottoman period, architecture and urbanism was influenced by the Islamic culture and the process of Islamization. In contemporary Turkey, several coups have shifted Turkey’s architecture and urbanism from the Islamic style to modern style[4].</p>

                        <p>During the former Ottoman rule, architecture and urbanism were used to centralize the empire’s territories. Early Ottoman architecture developed from both Seljuk, Armenian and Persian architecture. In the 14 centuries, the Ottoman Empire conquered Constantinople and relocated its capital to it, renaming the city Istanbul. Since then, Ottoman architecture has absorbed the Byzantine architectural style and Islamization took place. The Hagia Sophia is the best example of this process. The Byzantine church was converted to a Muslim mosque by retaining its structure while adding minarets as an Islamic element, creating the new Ottoman architecture style. Infrastructure also took shape in the Ottoman period by the establishment of imarets, a complex which included a mosque, religious colleges, a bath, and a public kitchen. Such complexes functioned as a community while defining neighbourhoods and family bonds[5].</p>

                        <p>After the fall of the Ottoman Empire, the modern Turkish Republic was established in 1923. Turkish architecture was still influenced by Seljuk and Ottoman architecture in the early years of the Republic. In 1930s, due to the influence of modernism brought by foreign architects who were invited by the government to build the new capital city, Turkish architecture started to differ from the traditional architectural style. However, due to lack of financial support and technological infrastructure, the Turkish architecture industry was constrained in experimenting with new styles of architecture. Until the coup in the 1980s, the government started a reform program which liberalised Turkey’s economy, resulting in strong economic growth while benefiting the architecture industry. Nowadays, lots of innovative projects with different architecture styles are presented in Turkey[6].</p>

                        <p>Turkey and Hong Kong seem to be two completely different regions that have no connection with one another. However, the two regions have quite a few similarities in terms of international position, cultural diversity, and accelerating dictatorship. Hong Kong and Turkey both act as the border of their surrounding countries. Hong Kong connected China with the international world while turkey connected Europe with Asia and Middle East. Due to the similar international position, both areas are deeply influenced by Western culture. Induce the formation of intercultural society that integrated Western culture with their own traditional background[7].</p>

                        <p>The two regions have a complete different political environment in terms of government system and political structure. Since the handover to China, Hong Kong become a special administrative region that use the economic and administrative system inherited from the British colonial history, under the “one country, two system” principle. Modern Turkish state is founded as secular parliamentary democracy after the collapse of Ottoman empire. The government was ruled by single-party in first years and transitioned to multi-party democracy in 1950s. However, both regions have the tendency of descending democratization which can be verify from series events occurred recently, from the murder of journalist in Turkey to the kidnap of bookstore owner in Hong Kong [8].</p>

                        <p>Modern Hong Kong and Turkey’s architecture are similar in style, both have no reference to the historical past while fully adopted modern style. However, historical architecture of the two regions are completely different. Turkey’s historical architecture are dominated by Islamic architecture with very few variations of different architecture style. In contrast, Hong Kong has many diverse historical architectures, mainly consist of Chinese, British and colonial architecture style. Despite the differences of style in historical architecture, both regions utilised a similar process in developing their architecture. Colonial architecture in Hong Kong combined British architecture style with Hong Kong characteristic. Ottoman architecture absorbed Byzantine architecture style with Islamic elements. Therefore, colonial architecture and Islamic architecture can both be considered as hybrid architecture due to the integration of two different elements[9].</p>

                        <p>Urban environment in Hong Kong and Turkey are contrast in density aspect. Turkey’s city center are packed with high-rise building while residential area remains in more spacious environment. In contrast, most areas in Hong Kong are constructed as high-density urban environment with overcrowded living condition. In terms of historical preservation, Turkey dedicate in protecting its historical building while keeping a balance of new architecture development at the same time. Hong Kong, on the other hand, demolished lots of historical building to make space for new architecture development due to the lack of land supply.[10]</p>
